Dependency Info (Maven Central): `com.pajato.io:KFile-<target>:0.0.2` where targets are `jvm` and `native`

Provides a file abstraction that mimics a Java File object for the JVM and native platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac)

Version 0.0.1 gets the ball rolling and implements a few File methods sufficient to support a simple text file.

Complete testing is provided.  JVM code coverage is 100%.  Native code coverage is a work in progress.

PR's are welcome.
