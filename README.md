# KFile
Kotlin multi-platform file library.

Provides a file abstraction that mimics a Java File object for the JVM and native platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac)

Version 0.0.1 gets the ball rolling and implements a few File methods sufficient to support a simple text file.

Complete testing is provided.  JVM code coverage is 100%.  Native code coverage is a work in progress.

PR's are welcome.
